 GIF Ranking Automation Project üöÄ

This project is developed as part of an assignment for Persist Ventures. It focuses on automating and manipulating the ranking of GIFs on platforms like **Tenor** and **Giphy**. The objective is to analyze the API mechanisms responsible for ranking GIFs based on search terms and create a system that ranks a specific GIF at the top position.
üìå Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Identify the API logic and mechanisms behind GIF ranking on Tenor and Giphy.
- Develop a system that can manipulate the rankings to position a target GIF as the **top result** for a given search term.
- Automate the process through a full-stack application, Telegram bot, or another innovative solution.

 üìã Technical Stack

- **API Analysis Tools**: [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com/) for monitoring and analyzing API calls.
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python / Spring Boot (depending on implementation choice).
- **Frontend**: React.js or a minimal UI for testing and demonstrations.
- **Telegram Bot Framework**: For automation and ranking manipulation.
    Database**: MySQL / MongoDB (optional, for logging or interaction tracking).
 ‚öôÔ∏è Features

1. **API Monitoring**: 
   - Track and analyze API calls made to platforms like Tenor and Giphy.
   - Identify ranking factors such as views, shares, or interactions.

2. **Ranking Automation**:
   - Implement logic to manipulate rankings and position the GIF at the **top**.
   - Automate the process via a Telegram bot or backend script.

3. **Proof of Success**:
   - Provide a working video demonstration of a target GIF ranking at the top position.



 üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  cd GIF-Ranking-Automation
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install  # Or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python
   npm start    # Or python app.py
   ```

3. Set up the frontend (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Configure the bot (if applicable):
   - Add your Telegram bot token in `bot/config.js`.
   - Start the bot:
     ```bash
     cd bot
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

5. Run the ranking automation script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node rankGif.js  # Replace with the appropriate script command
